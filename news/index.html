        <h2><b>The state of Rhino Linux. Development Update #1</b> - Feburary 25th, 2023.</h2>
        <p>
            Rhino Linux has now been in active development since October 2022. The core vision for the distribution has remained the same throughout the development cycle. Many things have changed since our original announcement detailing the development of the distribution, though.  <br>

        <h2><b>Moving forward with Rolling Rhino Remix</b> - October 16th, 2022.</h2>
        <p>
            Overtime the current development model of Rolling Rhino Remix has became untenable. It really is a passion project with code that is not mature. I made it for fun, but it became too big, too quickly, and unfortunately the immature code that makes the distribution is still present today. Rhino Linux will be an Ubuntu-based, rolling release operating system with Ubuntu, Pacstall and XFCE at the core of the distribution. <br>
