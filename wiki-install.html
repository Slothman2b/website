    Installation guide
  </h1>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    Here is the official installation guide for Rhino Linux. This guide assumes that you have created a bootable USB drive with a Rhino Linux disk image, if you have not, you can find guides online for how to create a Live bootable Linux USB on Windows, macOS or Linux. You can grab the latest Rhino Linux disk image <a href="index.html#download" class="text-rhino-purple">here</a>.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-center text-off-white text-3xl mt-4">
    GRUB Bootloader
  </h1>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    When you boot from your Live USB you will be greeted with the GRUB Bootloader, which is the most commonly used bootloader for Linux systems. You will want to select "Try or Install Rhino Linux" - Which should be selected by default, and press enter.
    <br><br> â€¢ You may need to disable secureboot in your UEFI/BIOS beforehand.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-center text-off-white text-3xl mt-4">
    Booting to desktop
  </h1>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    When you first boot into your live system, the installer will not automatically start, rather you are immediately given the chance to try Rhino Linux on your liveUSB environment. When you are ready to install Rhino Linux you can click on the icon on your desktop, this will then launch our customised Calamares Installer.
  </p>

  <h1 class="text-center text-off-white text-3xl mt-4">
    Installer
  </h1>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    When you first boot into the installer, you will be asked to select your language layout. Afterwards you will need to select your location so that the system can accurately grab your timezone. You will then need to select your keyboard layout, you are also able to test your keyboard layout to ensure it is correct.
  </p>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    You will then need to select how you will partition your disks, your usual options are to install alongside an existing operating system, erase the entire contents of the disk and install Rhino Linux or manually partition your disks. Finally you will need to provide a name, username, a name for your computer and then your password. Afterwards you will be given a summary of the changes you are about to make, and then you can confirm this and begin your install.
  </p>

  <p class="text-off-white mt-4">
    Once the install is complete, it is recommended you read our <a href="wiki-quickstart.html" class="text-rhino-purple">Quick Start Guide</a> to understand how to utilise Rhino Linux as it was intended.
